This is a TO-DO webapp that allows users to login/register for an account and to add, delete and update tasks as they wish. 

As the user is using the app, the javascript fetch API makes various calls to the backend codebase written in GO. 
The backend has functions that deal with the user's commands, including editing the database through a Postgresql docker container.

To get started:

- Clone the repository
- Run 
```"docker compose build"``` followed by ```"docker compose up" ```

Thats it!
